# Student Management Api

A web application for teachers to manage their students' grades, homework, and projects

## Getting Started
- Before running the web application, you need to start the auth-service for authentication and authorization. You can find instructions for starting the auth-service in [this](https://github.com/orbirpinar/student-management-auth-service) repository.
- After starting the auth-service, run `make up` to spin up all Docker containers.
- Then you can access [swagger docs](http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html)
- To stop all Docker containers, run `make down`.
